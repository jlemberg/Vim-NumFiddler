NumFiddler
==========

NumFiddler is a Vim plugin fiddling with numbers.

When in normal mode, move your cursor over a number and press Ctrl + Up-Arrow / Down-Arrow to increase / decrease said number.

Also, if your Vim installation supports Floats (and quite frankly, I don't see why It wouldn't), you can use Alt + Up/Down to increase / decrease in steps of 0.1

Installation
===

Simply place NumFiddler.vim in your ~/.vim/plugin folder and you're good to go!
